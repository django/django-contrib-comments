=============================================
Settings that ``django_comments`` understands
=============================================

.. setting:: COMMENTS_HIDE_REMOVED

COMMENTS_HIDE_REMOVED
---------------------

If ``True`` (default), removed comments will be excluded from comment
lists/counts (as taken from template tags). Otherwise, the template author is
responsible for some sort of a "this comment has been removed by the site staff"
message.

.. setting:: COMMENT_MAX_LENGTH

COMMENT_MAX_LENGTH
------------------

The maximum length of the comment field, in characters. Comments longer than
this will be rejected. Defaults to 3000.

.. setting:: COMMENTS_APP

COMMENTS_APP
------------

An app which provides :doc:`customization of the comments framework
<custom>`.  Use the same dotted-string notation
as in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.  Your custom :setting:`COMMENTS_APP`
must also be listed in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.

.. setting:: COMMENTS_TIMEOUT

COMMENT_TIMEOUT
------------------

The maximum comment form timeout in seconds. The default value is
``2 * 60 * 60`` (2 hours).


COMMENTS_ID_OVERRIDES
----------------------

.. setting:: COMMENTS_ID_OVERRIDES

A dictionary of ``{"app_label": "id_field"}`` pairs that override the
PK used for referencing comment objects.

If you want to disguise the plain IDs of your referenced model used by the comment form, you can
use uuid field as an ID for the model. You don't have to change the model to use different PK.
For example::

    COMMENTS_ID_OVERRIDES = {
        "myapp.MyModel": "uuid",
    }
