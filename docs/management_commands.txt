delete_stale_comments
=====================

Remove comments for which the related objects don't exist anymore!
This is a handy house-keeping command because the comment model
doesn't enforce cascade delete on the database level! Run:

    .. code-block:: shell

        manage.py delete_stale_comments

This command supports the ``--yes`` flag to automatically confirm
suggested deletions, suitable for running via cron.
